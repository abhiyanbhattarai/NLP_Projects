# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project

Welcome to the Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project! This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on Twitter data to predict the sentiment (positive or negative) of tweets. The project involves the implementation of two models: a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with TF-IDF features and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model with one-hot encoding.

## Data
The dataset used for this project comprises a collection of tweets gathered from Twitter.

## Project Objectives
- Implement a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier using TF-IDF features for sentiment analysis.
- Develop a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model with one-hot encoding to capture sequential patterns in text.
- Compare the performance of both models in terms of accuracy and other relevant metrics.
- Provide insights into the strengths and limitations of each approach.

## Files and Folders
- `data/`: Download link for twitter data is provided above.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

- Provide an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of each model in handling sentiment analysis tasks.
- Offer suggestions for further improvements and extensions of the project.

## Conclusion
This project showcases the implementation and comparison of two different models for Twitter sentiment analysis. By using SVM with TF-IDF and LSTM with one-hot encoding, the project highlights the impact of different techniques in capturing sentiment from text data. The insights gained from this project contribute to a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities in sentiment analysis.
