# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project

Welcome to the Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project! This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on Twitter data to predict the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of tweets. The project involves the implementation of two models: a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with TF-IDF features and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model with one-hot encoding.

## Data
The dataset used for this project comprises a collection of tweets gathered from Twitter. Each tweet is labeled with its corresponding sentiment, making it a suitable dataset for training and evaluating sentiment analysis models.

## Project Objectives
- Implement a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier using TF-IDF features for sentiment analysis.
- Develop a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model with one-hot encoding to capture sequential patterns in text.
- Compare the performance of both models in terms of accuracy and other relevant metrics.
- Provide insights into the strengths and limitations of each approach.

## Files and Folders
- `data/`: The directory containing the dataset used for training and evaluation.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `models/`: Saved model files after training.
- `utils/`: Utility scripts for preprocessing and other functions.
- `README.md`: This file, offering a comprehensive overview of the project.

## Usage
1. Download or obtain the dataset and place it in the `data/` folder.
2. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
3. Execute the necessary scripts to train the SVM and LSTM models.
4. Check the `models/` folder for saved model files.
5. Review the insights and performance metrics provided in the notebooks to understand each model's effectiveness.
