# NLP Spam-Ham Detection Project

Welcome to the NLP Spam-Ham Detection Project! This project focuses on using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify messages as either spam or ham (legitimate). The project employs both a Naive Bayes (NB) classifier and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to achieve accurate message classification.

## Data

The dataset used for this project is available for download. You can access it using the following link:

The dataset consists of labeled examples of both spam and ham messages. It has been preprocessed and is ready for use in training and evaluating the models.

## Project Objectives

- Implement a Naive Bayes classifier for baseline message classification.
- Develop an LSTM model to capture sequential patterns in text data.
- Compare the performance of both models in terms of accuracy and other metrics.
- Provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.
